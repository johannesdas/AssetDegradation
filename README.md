# AssetDegradation

Work in progress.

## Purpose

To create a model which successfully predicts the failure of jet engines and allows them to be repaired. The data was taken from the public dataset released by NASA: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps

## Modelling

The modelling will be partitioned into three parts: Regression models, Classification models and Neural Networks. Each model will involve hyperparameter tuning in order to minimize the scores. A variety of measurements will be used to measure the efficacy of the models: R^2, RMSE and cross-entropy loss are just a few.

## Projected Timeline

This project will likely be finished by the end of June 2024.
